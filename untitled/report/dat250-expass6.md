# Messaging Systems #

I was not met with any problems while doing the Expass 6 experiments.
The messaging system was easy to set up and I had no problems with going through the experiments 
and testing the rabbit messaging tool. The steps were easy to follow.

PS: The code is found in the source directory in this project structure.
